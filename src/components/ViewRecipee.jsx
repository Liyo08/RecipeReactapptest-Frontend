Heat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a few drops of oil and spread it evenly.
Take a ladleful of dosa batter and pour it onto the hot griddle. Swirl the batter to form a thin, crepe-like circle.
Add a spoonful of potato masala in the center of the dosa.
Once the bottom starts to brown, carefully fold one side over the filling, then fold the other side over to create a half-moon or envelope shape.
Drizzle a little more oil around the edges and cook for another 30 seconds or until crispy.
Serve hot with coconut chutney or sambar.
Tips:If the dosa batter seems too thick, add a tablespoon of water at a time to thin it out.
You can adjust the amount of potato masala filling to your preference.
Pre-made frozen potato masala or even leftover mashed potatoes can be used for a quicker option.
